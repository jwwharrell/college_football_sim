# College Football Simulator Game Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive college football simulator game focusing on the dynamic ecosystem of NCAA football divisions (1FBS, 1FCS, 2, and 3). The game simulates an environment where success in football can lead to financial benefits for the school and its football program. It will feature an extensive database of schools, players, and coaches, allowing for a deep and immersive management experience.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Rust
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Frontend (planned):** Unity (or an alternative game engine)

## Database Schema

The database includes three main entities: Schools, Athletes, and Coaches. Each entity has a set of basic attributes suitable for the initial phase of the game development.

- **Schools:** Contains information about each school, including its name, division, and budget.
- **Coaches:** Stores details about coaches, including their skills and the school they are associated with.
- **Athletes:** Includes player details such as name, position, and various performance-related attributes.

## Current Progress

- Basic SQL schema for the database has been defined.
- A simple Rust program has been created to set up and seed the database with initial data.
- Initial data includes two schools, each with one coach and two players.

## Installation and Running the Program

Instructions for setting up the development environment, including installing Rust, SQLite, and any other necessary tools, will be provided.

## Future Developments

- Development of the game's frontend using Unity or a suitable alternative.
- Integration of the Rust backend with the chosen frontend.
- Expansion of the database schema to include more detailed attributes and additional entities such as games, tournaments, and player stats.
- Implementation of game logic that accurately simulates football matches and the effects of management decisions.
